# Logistic-Regression-from-scratch
Example of the Logistic Regression class, written from scratch.


## This is a training example which could help understand more how logistic regression works.

## How to use
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer


X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)  # load the dataset

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.20, random_state = 42)  # split the dataset

# Create an instance of the LogisticRegression class

logit = LogisticRegression(learning_rate=0.1, num_iter=200000)  # you can play with hyperparameters to understand how learning rate works.

# Train the model

logit.train(X_train, y_train)

# Normalize output generated by sigmoid function

y_pred = [int(round(x)) for x in logit.predict_prob(X_test).flatten()]  # you can do it much sipler it`s just me

# look at the score

score = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)  # 0.956 -> 95.6 %.
```
